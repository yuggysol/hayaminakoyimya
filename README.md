# YUGGY'S AFTER-PARTY: THE SYSTEM VAULT (CHEAT CODES)

Welcome to the "After-Party". This is where the "PnL Monster" shares the *real* cheat codes.

On Twitter, we *hunt*. Here, we *calculate*.

---

## INTRO: SYSTEM > HOPE (MY PLEB-TO-MONSTER STORY)

[‚ùóÔ∏è **TASK (SPINNERETTE):** Spinnerette's v3.0 ("Degen Jester") write-up of your +10,272% (PnL) "Pleb to Monster" story goes here. Include the visuals of your first "losing PnLs" and then the "peak" PnL as proof.]

---

## Step 1: Understanding "The Joke" (Why You're Still Losing)

You're not a "pleb" because of your "mindset". You're a pleb because you're *designed* to be "exit liquidity".

* **What is "Hopium Dealing"?**
    (When a KOL says "just double it 8 times" or "$10M is realistic", you're not the customer. You're the product.)

* **The #FuckTheKOLs Manifesto**
    (We don't "hope". We *calculate*.)

---

## Step 2: Gearing Up (The PnL Monster's Arsenal)

A "system" doesn't have to be "boring". It's a "cheat code".

### 1. "The Printer": Dbot (Dbot) Settings

This is where you stop "sweating" and start "printing". This is Step 1 to "stop the bleeding".

[‚ùóÔ∏è **TASK 1 (YOU):** Embed your "Dbot Default Settings" video here. (Upload it to YouTube as "Unlisted" and drop the link).]

### 2. "The Hunting Radar": Axiom (Axiom) & The WHAD Method (The WHAD Method)

* (A simple breakdown of the WHAD Method (Dbot+Axiom Synergy) (Dbot+Axiom Synergy) goes here.)
* (A short intro on how we find Proven Wallets (Proven Wallets) to copy‚Äîreferencing the WHAD "Curated Wallets" (Curated Wallets) feature.)

---

## Step 3: Join the "After-Party" (Where The Real Alpha Is)

This "System Vault" is the *start*. The real "jokes" and *real-time* alpha are in the "After-Party" (Telegram).

* **[CLICK HERE: JOIN YUGGY'S AFTER-PARTY (YOUR TELEGRAM LINK)]**
* (What we promise inside: "Voice notes, early signals, system logic")
